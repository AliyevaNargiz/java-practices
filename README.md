# Java Programming Practice

This repository contains weekly Java programming practice exercises.

## Week 01

Contains basic Java programs demonstrating fundamental concepts:

1. **Sum.java** - Program that takes two integers from user and calculates their sum using Scanner class.
2. **Calc.java** - Program that performs basic arithmetic operations (sum, subtraction, multiplication, division, remainder) using command-line arguments.
3. **Time.java** - Program that converts seconds into hours, minutes, and seconds format.
4. **PolarityOfNumber.java** - Program that determines if a given floating-point number is positive, negative, or zero.
5. **MonthInfo.java** - Program that displays month information (name and number of days) based on month number input.

### How to Run

1. Compile any program:
```bash
javac ProgramName.java
```

2. Run the compiled program:
```bash
java ProgramName
```

Note: For Calc.java, provide two numbers as command-line arguments:
```bash
java Calc 10 5
```
